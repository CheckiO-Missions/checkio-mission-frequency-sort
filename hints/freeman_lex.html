        I have no idea how to start solving this mission.

    <div class="answer">
        <p>The general idea is simple - to define sorting rule correctly and to use
        it as a key in sorting function.</p>

        What should I start from?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Use build-in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_sorted.asp">sorted()</a> function. It returns sorted list or another Iterable and has <b class="code">key</b> argument, which defines the rule of sorting (that's exactly what you need).</p>

        Ok. What to do next?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p><b class="code">Key</b> argument (sorting rule) is a function, which compares elements by some parameter and chooses, what element goes first. To define specific function, use <b class="code">lambda</b>  expression (anonymous function), that takes each element in the list.</p>

result = sorted(items, key=lambda i: ...)

    <div class="answer">
        <p>Description says, that you need to sort elements according to their frequency - 
        number of occurrences in the list. A common way to count number of the same
        element in the list is to use its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_count.asp">list.count()</a> method.</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
items = [1, 2, 3, 2]
print(items.count(3))
        </pre>
        <div class="output">
            Output
            <pre>
1
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>So, you need to use this method for sorting.</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
result = sorted(items, key=lambda i: items.count(i))        
        </pre> 
        <p>The default sorting order is increasing, so an element with 1 occurrence will
        go before the one with 2. But according to the description you need the 
        opposite - more frequent element should go first. To get this do such easy
        yet tricky thing - use result of <b class="code">count</b>  with minus! So, the element with
        "-2" frequency goes before the one with "-1" frequency, since -2 is less then -1.</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
result = sorted(items, key=lambda i: -items.count(i))        
        </pre> 
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        But what to do, when two or more elements have equal frequency?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>The mission description says, you need to sort them by first appearance in the list.
        Use list method <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_index.asp">list.index()</a>, which returns the index of first occurrence of the element in the list. Since the element with smaller index should go earlier than with bigger (ascending order), no need to use minus, default sorting order is fine.</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
result = sorted(items, key=lambda i: -items.count(i), items.index(i))
        </pre>

    <div class="question">
        So, how my final solution should look like?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>One small step about code remains: sorting function should be a single object, but now
        you have two - <b class="code">-items.count(i)</b> and <b class="code">index(i)</b> items. To make it works, join them in a tuple or list. Don't forget to wrap the code into function expression (with type hints) and return the expressions you build. So, here is the solution:</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
from typing import Iterable


def frequency_sort(items: list[str|int]) -> Iterable[str|int]:

    result = sorted(items, key=lambda i: (-items.count(i), items.index(i)))

    return result

    <div class="answer">
        <p>Sure, grab it!</p>
        <p>In this solution there are two steps: first to sort <b class="code">items</b> ascending by index, then descending by frequency. Pay attention to the argument
        <b class="code">reverse</b> which is <b class="code">False</b> by default and the absence of <b class="code">lambda</b> expression.</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
from typing import Iterable


def frequency_sort(items: list[str|int]) -> Iterable[str|int]:

    items = sorted(items, key=items.index)
    items = sorted(items, key=items.count, reverse=True)
    
    return items
        </pre>
        <p><b class="code">Counter</b> class from <b class="code">collections</b> module creates a dictionary with unique elements as keys and their frequency as values. Pairs ordered by first appearance. So you take all elements, sort them by key - frequency of each element (<b class="code">c.get</b> gets for each element its value from <b class="code">c</b> ) with descending order.</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
from typing import Iterable
from collections import Counter


def frequency_sort(items: list[str|int]) -> Iterable[str|int]:

    c = Counter(items)
    result = sorted(c.elements(), key=c.get, reverse = True)

    return result
